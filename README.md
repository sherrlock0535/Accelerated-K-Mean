# Accelerated-K-Mean
Using the triangle inequality to accelerate k-mean
## English
According to the paper [Using the Triangle Inequality to Accelerate
-Mean](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-022.pdf), the standard k-mean algorithm can be accelerated by triangle inequality. This code implement this method by c++.
